Utilizing memory-: Sometimes a table is needed for a short period of time. Maybe used just by a single query or stored procedure OR used by a no. of actions but over a 
                   extended time period.
                   Solution-: Use Virtual tables OR perform read/write operations on tables from memory intead of disk.
                   Use -> Derived Tables.                  
                          Table Variables.                  
                          Common Table Expressions (CTE)
                          
Derived Table-: is a virtual table that is created and used within the scope of a query.
                It is discarded when the query completes.
                Can be considered as a temporary view.
                Disadvantages-: The table is created every time the query is run.
                                They don't utilize indexes. (Have to scan the whole table)
                e.g. select * from (select firstname,lastname from person.person) as dperson where lastname like 'I%'
        
Table Variable-: e.g. DECLARE @MTL as TABLE
                       (FirstName varchar(40),
                        LastName varchar(40),
                        Orders int,
                        OrderTot int)
                        
                      Insert into @MTL 
                       (FirstName,LastName,Orders,OrderTot)
                      select p.FirstName, p.LastName, COUNT(*), SUM(soh.TotalDue)
                      from person.person p
                      join
                      sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
                      on
                      p.BusinessEntityID=soh.SalesPersonID
                      group by Firstname, Lastname
                          
Common Table Expression-: is a more readable form of a derived table.
                          It is declared once.
                          e.g. WITH dperson (lastname,firstname)
                               AS
                                 (select lastname,firstname from person.person)
                               select lastname,firstname from dperson
                               where lastname like 'I%'
                          
Temporary Tables-: a physical table that exists temporarily in the TempDB database.
                   Exists as long as it is being used.
                   Types-: Local-: Created with a #prefix (e.g. #parts)
                                   Visible only to the user who created it in the current connection.
                                   Deleted when the user disconnects.
                           Global-: Created with a ##prefix (e.g. ##parts)
                                    Visible to any user in the database.
                                    Deleted when the user disconnects if no one else is using it.
                   Advantages-: Supports Indexes.
                                Better performance for very large datasets.
                                Utilizes less memory than other options.
                   Disadvantages-: Uses disk based read-write operations (slow).
                   e.g. create table #mark
                        (lname varchar (10))
