1. Logical Processing -> How the query is constructed -> Syntax and style
2. Physical Processing -> How the result is obtained -> Database engine must figure out how to get the results

Queries are written in this order-: 
   SELECT
   FROM 
   WHERE
   GROUP BY
   HAVING
   ORDER BY
But the queries are executed in this order-:
   FROM
   WHERE 
   GROUP BY
   HAVING
   SELECT
   ORDER BY
   
Query Optimization-:
                    1. Parsing -> Parsed for syntax, object existance (binding), permission etc and translates the SQL query into a tree of logical operators representing the 
                                  high-level steps required to execute the query.
                    2. Generate Execution plans -> Different ways to produce the result set are created
                    3. Cost assessment of plans -> Which way is most efficient
                    4. Query execution and plan caching -> The chosen plan is executed and cached for later use
                    
Best Practices for writing queries in SQL-:
1. Don't use SELECT * in a production environment
2. Avoid unnecessary columns in the SELECT list
3. Avoid unnecessary tables in joins
4. Avoid using OR if possible
5. Avoid using NOT if possible
6. Use SCHEMA.TABLE naming in your queries
7. Always include a WHERE clause if possible.
